"""Build the per-run worktree: a pinned, sanitized, history-free checkout.

The order matters and is load-bearing:

1. ``create_worktree`` — shallow single-commit checkout at the pinned commit.
2. ``prefetch_submodules`` — pull non-banned runtime submodules, preferring
   the parent repo's local copies; sanitize newly materialized sources.
3. The caller creates the worktree's venv and installs packages while the
   native tools build can still check the original submodule metadata.
4. The caller prepares skills, hooks and references, then applies restrictions
   to both the reference copies and the installed packages.
5. ``scrub_worktree_git`` — remove source Git metadata and re-init one clean-room
   commit so history cannot resurrect banned sources. The venv stays ignored.
