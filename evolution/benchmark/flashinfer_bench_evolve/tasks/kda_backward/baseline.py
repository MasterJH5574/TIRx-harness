    The harness times the CUPTI span of one call (first kernel start to last
    kernel end). FLA's forward plus backward is 31-33 Triton launches, and
    eager launching leaves host-dependent gaps between them inside that span:
    on this shared host the ~1 ms portfolio rows read 2.0-2.8x their kernel
    time at load average ~75 while the 8 ms H96 row reads +2%. PR #4636
    measures the same eager span (``bench_gpu_time(enable_cupti=True,
    cold_l2_cache=True, use_cuda_graph=False)``) on its own host; the graph
    replay here is a deliberate deviation that removes the gaps so the timed
    span is the kernels alone and reproducible. It is not the PR's number: the
    PR's FLA figure includes whatever launch gaps its host had.

    The eager call first finishes Triton's autotune and fills FLA's
    identity-keyed ``tensor_cache`` of chunk indices for this ``cu_seqlens``
    object, so the capture neither tunes nor syncs the host. The graph reads
    the leaves through raw device pointers, so the arguments are returned
    alongside it: the harness drops its own reference to the prepared inputs
    as soon as ``prepare`` returns, and a freed input block would be handed to
    the next allocation and replayed as garbage.
